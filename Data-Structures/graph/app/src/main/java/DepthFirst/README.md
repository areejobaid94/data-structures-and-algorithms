# Graphs BreadthFirst
Implementing Graphs DepthFirst.

## Challenge
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
#### Time complexity:-
    * depthFirstGraph(): O(n) => for loop and recartion;

#### Space complexity:
    * depthFirstGraph(): O(n) => We have ArrayList.
