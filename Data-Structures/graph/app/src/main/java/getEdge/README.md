# Graphs BreadthFirst
Implementing check  whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Challenge
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.
## Approach & Efficiency
#### Time complexity:-
    * checkFullTripPossibility(): O(n^3) => Two for loops and While;

#### Space complexity:
    * checkFullTripPossibility(): O(n) => We have ArrayList.
