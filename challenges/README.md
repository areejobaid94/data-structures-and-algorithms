# Class 1
# Reverse an Array
This solution for Reverse an Array using JAVA Method;

## Challenge
Write a function called `reverseArray` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used four solutions to solve this problem =>
* In the first solution I solved the problem by using for loop and return new array;
* In the 2nd solution I solved the problem by using for loop and modify the arg array;
* In the 3rd solution I solved the problem by using recursion and overlaod and modify the arg arr;
* In the 4th solution I solved the problem by using recursion and overlaod and return new array;
